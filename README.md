# portfolio

This is a personal portfolio showcasing projects I built through the Skillcrush Break Into Tech Front End Developer Program. 
The portfolio itself was built using the Bootstrap CDN. The projects within the portfolio are deployed on GitHub Pages, Code Sandbox, or Replit.
The projects showcased use various languages/technologies including HTML/CSS, Vanilla JavaScript, React, Python, Flask, and SQL.
